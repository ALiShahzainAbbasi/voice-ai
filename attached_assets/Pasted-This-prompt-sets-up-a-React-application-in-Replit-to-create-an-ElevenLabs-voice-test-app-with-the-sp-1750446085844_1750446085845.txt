Explanation of Key Features
Form Fields:
Personality: Dropdown with EightLabs-inspired options, mapped to voice settings (e.g., Unhinged uses low stability for erratic speech).
Voice: Dropdown populated with ElevenLabs voices via API, supporting custom voice profiles.
Sex: Male/Female dropdown for demographic context.
Age: Slider (18–80) for age customization.
Race: Dropdown with common options and "Other" for flexibility.
Religion: Dropdown with major religions and "None"/"Other."
Political Leaning: Slider (-100 to 100) for Left to Right spectrum.
State Management: Friends stored as an array of objects in React state, limited to 4, with fields for all attributes.
Voice Mapping: Each personality maps to specific ElevenLabs voice settings (stability, similarity_boost) to ensure consistent output (e.g., Romantic uses higher stability for smoother speech).
Real-Time Audio: Audio is generated via ElevenLabs' TTS API and played using the browser's Audio API, with a loading state to prevent multiple plays.
UI: Tailwind CSS ensures a clean, mobile-friendly design with minimal elements, aligning with your preference for simple UIs.
Setup in Replit
Create a new Node.js repl in Replit.
Copy the file structure and code from the artifact above.
Install dependencies via Replit’s terminal: npm install react react-dom axios tailwindcss vite @vitejs/plugin-react.
Configure Tailwind and Vite as shown in the config files.
Add your ElevenLabs API key to ELEVENLABS_API_KEY.
Run the repl to launch the app in the preview window.
Usage
Enter text in the textarea (e.g., "Hello, I’m your virtual friend!").
For each friend, customize their attributes using the form.
Click "Play Voice" to hear the text spoken in the selected voice, adjusted for their personality.
Adjust settings and replay to test different configurations.
Notes
API Key: Secure your ElevenLabs API key in production (use Replit’s .env secrets).
Limitations: The free ElevenLabs plan limits usage; consider a paid plan for extensive testing.
Custom Voices: To use custom voices, create them in ElevenLabs’ voice lab and manually add their voice_id to the app if the API doesn’t list them.
Ethical Use: Ensure compliance with ElevenLabs’ guidelines, especially for voice cloning or sensitive attributes like race/religion.
Extensibility: You can extend this with features like saving configurations to localStorage or integrating trending topics from Grok, as in your past requests.
